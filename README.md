### 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Software Engineer** with a strong front-end focus and a passion for building accessible, inclusive, and high-quality digital products.

🔍 With a hybrid background in **full-stack development** and **QA (manual & automated testing)**, I thrive at the intersection of code, usability, and quality.

🎨 My curiosity led me to study **UX, accessibility, and behavior science**, and I'm currently pursuing **Design with a focus on project management in tech**. I believe in the power of **human-computer interaction** to shape better tools for everyone.

🧠 I'm also an advocate for **neurodiversity in tech**. As an autistic woman in the field, I care deeply about designing **empathetic**, **accessible**, and **human-centered** solutions.

🤖 In my free time, I love exploring creative projects involving **AI**, always looking for new ways to combine technology, creativity, and social good.
