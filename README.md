  :woman_technologist: About me :<br>

  Hi 🙋🏻‍♀️, I’m a tech enthusiast focused on quality, user experience, and accessibility. I started as a developer and I’m currently studying software engineering to keep growing.
  I have a hybrid profile between developer and tester, and I enjoy building inclusive solutions with both code and low-code tools.

🌈 As an autistic person in tech, I value diversity and believe in the power of designing with empathy to create positive impact.

  Let’s connect and build something awesome together! 😊 <br>
